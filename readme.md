# JavaScript-part-2 DSA 📚

This repository contains my notes, implementations, and projects related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in JavaScript. This is the second part of my JavaScript learning journey, following the "Javascript-Part-1-Basic" repository, where I covered the basics of JavaScript 📖.

## What is in this Repository? 🤔

* Notes and implementation examples of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript
* Exercises and projects that demonstrate my understanding of DSA concepts
* Additional resources and references for further learning 📚

## Learning Outcomes 🎯

By going through this repository, I aim to gain a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms in JavaScript, including:

* Arrays and linked lists
* Stacks and queues
* Trees and graphs
* Hash tables and sets
* Sorting and searching algorithms
* Dynamic programming and more
