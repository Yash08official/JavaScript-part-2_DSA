## Time Complexity

It is basically used to check how your algorithm is running basically how much time the algorithm is taking to run the program

We can say time complexity is the measurement of time.

When you write a program , you need to determine how long this algorithm take (How much time it will take to execute)
But why we need the time complexity why we need measurement.

This measurement is required to check , if we have two ways of solving problem , if I have 1st A algorithm and 2nd B algorithm  then that time I will see which algorithm takes less time, which algorithm is efficient, which using less resources

Basically time complexity is a measurement of how your algorithm is working it basically depends on how your algorithm works that is the time measurement it gives 
So, this is about used for better programs 

It also depends on the length of the input (2nd parameter on time complexity), it means you have an array of numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and now I want to print all these numbers one by one . we know that we will be running the simple for loop where 
```js
(i = 0; i<a.length ; i++){
    console.log(a[i]);
}
```

Now that means , how many statement executed will be executed here , we know that how many statement executed "a.length" times and if i say this length can be "n" and n = 5 and this n of 1 thousand numbers and can be any
so , we know if we run this loop to print array of numbers it will take the amount of "n" steps to execute. So the time complexity is run 

and also one more thing is time also depends upon the machine , so some machine may have good processor some may have slow processor so it depends on the machine also

so , we used this time complexity 
1. how much time an algorithm will take to run
2. how much time the statement will executed 

and this measurement of seeing that how much time that my algorithm is going to take it depends on the length of the input so, this time complexity is determine using "n" value for that we used three types of notations

1. Big O notation
2. Omega notation
3. Theta notation
