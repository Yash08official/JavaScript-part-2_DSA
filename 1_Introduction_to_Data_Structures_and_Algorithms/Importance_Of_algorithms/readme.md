## Algorithm

Algorithm are the step by step instructions or procedures that help us solve problems or perform tasks

When you have to solve any problem you have to used algorithms which are ome step by step instructions which you give to computer to solve any problem  

So, algorithm are step by step instructions or procedures that help us solve perform solve problems or perform tasks.

Data structures are organized data efficiently and algorithm are the operation which we perform on that data so they both work together to store and to perform operations on that data efficiently

* Now, lets say you have a list of names and you want to solve all the elements in a alphabetical order so what you will be doing, you will be using algorithm to do that. Now to perform this operation there can be multiple algorithms. So to perform to solve the list of names in alphabetical order there can be multiple algorithms to do that so which algorithm should be select?

* So choosing the algorithm depends on various factors such as -
 1. size of the problem ::-> first you have to see the size of the problem
2. Resources available ::-> Resources available with you to solve the problem
 3. How quickly you need the solution for that problem
So algorithm depends on all this factors. You will try to choose best tool for your problem which takes less space, less resources and less time

### Importance of efficient algorithms

This are like shortcuts that help us solve complex problems quickly and with  minimum resources

That means you are solving all the problems quickly and with minimum resources 

Let say you are searching for a query on the web , when you search for any query on the web we get thousand of results in a seconds so very fast you get a lot of data and how you get that data so fast because there are some efficient algorithms which are running behind the scenes to process the vast amount of data. 
So we have vast amount of data those algorithms are processing that data and giving us the results which we want so, those algorithms are efficient algorithms, thats why they are able to give us data so fast

Efficient algorithm helps us to process the data faster , it makes your problem responsive , very fast. Your technology, your computers working so fast because of the efficient algorithms, they are the secret behind the technology which we have today 

Everywhere you want a seamless user experience, you want that everything should be fast
and what if behind the scene 
all these efficient algorithm they work behind the scene to give you seamless user experience
So, to measure the algorithm is efficient we used "algorithmic complexity analysis". So, we have something called as complexity analysis which basically analyze the algorithm and see how much time the algorithm take to run and how much space the algorithm take
so, with the help of time and space complexity analysis we identify which is the algorithm is efficient 
So, efficiency of the algorithm is depend upon by calculating the the time it takes and the amount of memory or space it requires

* Speed and resource usage
* Solve problem quickly
* Conserving valuable resources like time, memory and energy
