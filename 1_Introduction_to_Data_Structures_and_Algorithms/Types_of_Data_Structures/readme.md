## Linear Data Structures

There are different types of data structures " Linear" or "hierarchial" or "non - linear" data structures

1.Linear Data structures 

This are the type of data structures where elements are arranged sequentially means all the elements they are arranged in one single line and every element has their adjacent element. Basically every element has on the left hand side and their adjacent element on the right hand side apart from the first element and the last element

So, elements are arranged in sequentially in one single line and every element has a previous and the next element
so, it means that every element has Predecessor(previous element) and a Successor(next element) attach to it means every element connected to the previous element and to the next element 

They are all about organizing data in a sequential manner where each piece of data connected to predecessor and successor

* The order of elements 'addition' is maintained basically like how the elements are added , it is maintain 
* So, if the first element is added you can access or remove that element first, last element added will be the last to be accessed or removed
* It is like a order which you can access that element and you can remove that element 

#### Common Linear Data structures

* We have "arrays" => you can store data in sequential manner and here arrays are the fixed size . Whenever you will creating array it will be of fixed size array. so, elements which are of data, which is fixed size

* Then, you have "linked list" and the linked list has some dynamic size. So when you have linked list then you can randomly increased or decreased the elements. Means you can keep on adding the new elements in linked list you can removed the elements to the linked list and there are multiple nodes in a linked list and each node connected to its previous elements and to its next element 

* then we have "Stack" , it is a data structure where you push the elements in one order and later on you can access them.In stack it is not a fixed size  . it is a dynamic size , you keep on adding the elements later on 

So these are the "dynamic data structures"

* Then , you have "Queues" , inside queues the first element will goes that element come out first this is also a dynamic data structure

This is all about linear data structures


## Non-Linear Data Structures

* Data structures where elements are not placed in sequential manner or linear manner 
* elements are not connected to the previous and next element
* elements are not arranged in a single line or in a sequence
* We cannot traverse all the elements in a single run only
* They are arranges in a little bit complex manner 
* Elements are connected in web like structure, they are not connected sequentially
* They organized in a way they are facilitate branching and looping
* There are multiple relationship in data elements
* Ex : Trees , graphs
