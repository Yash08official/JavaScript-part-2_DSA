### Introduction to Data Structure 

Data structure is a tool designed to organize and store information efficiently

They facilitate easy retrieval and manipulation of data so that you can take any data and used that data

So, data structure are the tools which helps us organized and store our information 

There are multiple types of data structures like we have arrays , linked list, stack, tress, queues

So we can used any data structure from them depending on what is the usage

So, accordingly like how we are used it we can used the type of data structure we want

In this , we will studying about these different types od data structures in details

### The power of organized data efficiently

We have to keep our data organized inside our computer memory

We cannot keep our data scattered. we have to make it organized , so we can easily find our data in the memory
and processing of data become fast

Anything which is organized we can find out easily and fast

" The organized data makes of data runs fast ? " no, but also it save our space

Let say you have a stack of clothes , you are putting it in your almemar. If you are putting it in a organized manner , it takes less space , it saves your timing in finding the clothes, it also take less space

If the clothes takes less space 
Similarly in a computer memory if you are storing your data properly in organized manner it saves lot of space in the memory so it does not makes data fast , it finding data fast , it also helps to stored data in less space

" How we organized data efficiently"

So, inside your computer , here we have something called as Data Structures

This is a tool helps us organized data efficiently inside the computer so , with the help of data structures we cam easily organized data in memory

Let say we have list of numbers and we have to find the largest number or smallest number in the list So there are multiple data structure we will studying in this

Let say you can store data in arrays and heaps , we will easily able to find the largest number or smallest number in the list very fast

So the type of task we have to do and the type of data we have to store accordingly we need to decide the type of data structure

So what us "Algorithm" now
You have to store your data efficiently then you can run any algorithm in steps on the data stored
So , let say we have same data stored now you want to sort all the letters, alphabets alphabetically so that you can do that algorithm which will be run on that data it will be fast and also saves lot of resources

First organized data then on that data you can run the Algorithm and whats a Algorithm a program, a sequence, a step by step instructions that program efficiently 

You can used it in storing data , building website ,
When building data you have to focus data efficiently in building video games or analyzing any data
